# Thorek
Uses the previoud trait for Grombrindal, since his trait was designed with "Tradition" theme in mind, I think it fits Thorek well here.
## Stage 1 (level 10)
   * Miners(All variants):
      * +5 Melee Attack/Defence/Armour
      * +25% Weapon Strength
## Stage 2 (level 20)
   * Miners(All variants):
      * +10 Melee Attack/Defence/Armour
      * +50% Weapon Strength
## Stage 3 (level 30)
   * Miners(All variants):
      * +20 Melee Attack/Defence/Armour
      * +100% Weapon Strength
   * Miners(Blsting Charges):
      * Improves Missile Weapon (Better explosion, range and more, also apply "Shell Shocked")
      * +1400% (This is not a typo, since they only have a base value of 1, this gives them 15 ammo per battle)
   * Miners(Melee Variant):
      * Enable "Entrench" (Units cannot move if this ability is active. The first 10 second will not grant any bonus since they are still working on the Trench, afterwards, gain extra Melee Defence, Charge Resistance, Ward Save and Missile Resistance, you can activate this ability during deplyment phase to start this 10s countdown before the battle starts!) <br>
      (A total of 90% Missile Resistance is given after the effect kicks in, no thank you I don't care about your ratling gun. The overall buff is pretty ridiculous but this army can take heavy casualty if you leave enemy Artillery/Flame Thrower alive for too long or get ambushed)
   * Bolt Throwers:
      * Replace the normal fire mode with a new missile weapon, fires a volley of bolts (similar to the elven bolt throwers), and every bolt will cause a small explosion upon impact
